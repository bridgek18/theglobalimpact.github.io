<h3>Forego Fossil Fuels—</h3>
  <p>The first challenge is eliminating the burning of coal, oil and, eventually, natural gas. This is perhaps the most daunting challenge as denizens of richer nations literally eat, wear, work, play and even sleep on the products made from such fossilized sunshine. And citizens of developing nations want and arguably deserve the same comforts, which are largely thanks to the energy stored in such fuels.
</p>
<h3>Infrastructure Upgrade—</h3> 
  <p>Buildings worldwide contribute around one third of all greenhouse gas emissions (43 percent in the U.S. alone), even though investing in thicker insulation and other cost-effective, temperature-regulating steps can save money in the long run. Electric grids are at capacity or overloaded, but power demands continue to rise. And bad roads can lower the fuel economy of even the most efficient vehicle. Investing in new infrastructure, or radically upgrading existing highways and transmission lines, would help cut greenhouse gas emissions and drive economic growth in developing countries.</p>
<h3>Move Closer to Work—</h3> 
  <p>Transportation is the second leading source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. (burning a single gallon of gasoline produces 20 pounds of CO2). But it doesn't have to be that way. One way to dramatically curtail transportation fuel needs is to move closer to work, use mass transit, or switch to walking, cycling or some other mode of transport that does not require anything other than human energy. There is also the option of working from home and telecommuting several days a week.

    <ul>
      <li>Expand the use of renewable energy and transform our energy system to one that is cleaner and less dependent on coal and other fossil fuels. </li>
      <li> Increase vehicle fuel efficiency and support other solutions that reduce U.S. oil use.</li>
      <li>Place limits on the amount of carbon that polluters are allowed to emit.</li>
      <li>Build a clean energy economy by investing in efficient energy technologies, industries, and approaches.</li>
      <li>Reduce tropical deforestation and its associated global warming emissions.</li>

<button class="accordion">Deforestation</button>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>The best solution to deforestation is to curb the felling of trees, by employing a series of rules and laws to govern it. Deforestation in the current scenario may have reduced however it would be too early to assume. The money-churner that forest resources can be, is tempting enough for deforestation to continue.</li>
      <li>Clear cutting of forests must be banned. This will curb total depletion of the forest cover. It is a practical solution and is very feasible.</li>
      <li> Land skinned of its tree cover for urban settlements should be urged to plant trees in the vicinity and replace the cut trees. Also the cutting must be replaced by planting young trees to replace the older ones that were cut. Trees are being planted under several initiatives every year, but they still don’t match the numbers of the ones we’ve already lost.
</li>
    </ul>

<button class="accordion">Depletion of Resources</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>There are several steps you can take around your home to ensure that you aren't wasting clean water. One major step is to check for water leaks by reading your water meter, not running any water for 2 hours and then checking back to see if the meter still has the same reading. If it doesn't, you have a leak. Another effective way to conserve water is to replace or fix leaky faucets. A faucet that drips once per second can lead to 2,700 gallons of water loss in 1 year.</p>
  <p>Preventing the depletion of fossil fuels is usually discussed in terms of using less gasoline and electricity, which is typically produced through the burning of fossil fuels. Although driving less and carpooling more are obvious ways to conserve gasoline, purchasing locally grown or locally raised food products supports farms and companies that don't burn fossil fuels in shipping their products over long distances.</p>

  <button class="accordion">Pollution</button>
<div class="panel">
  <h3> Use Public Mode of Transportation </h3>
  <p>Encourage people to use more and more public modes of transportation to reduce pollution. Also, try to make use of carpooling. If you and your colleagues come from the same locality and have same timings you can explore this option to save energy and money.</p>
  <h3> Conserve Energy </h3>
  <p>Switch off fans and lights when you are going out. Large amount of fossil fuels are burnt to produce electricity. You can save the environment from degradation by reducing the amount of fossil fuels to be burned.</p>
  <h3>Understand the Concept of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle</h3>
  <p>Do not throw away items that are of no use to you. In-fact reuse them for some other purpose. For e.g. you can use old jars to store cereals or pulses.</p>
  <h3>Emphasis on Clean Energy Resources</h3>
  <p>Clean energy technologies like solar, wind and geothermal are on high these days. Governments of various countries have been providing grants to consumers who are interested in installing solar panels for their home. This will go a long way to curb air pollution.</p>

    <button class="accordion">Overpopulation</button>
<div class="panel">
  <h3>Better Education</h3>
  <p>One of the first measures is to implement policies reflecting social change. Educating the masses helps them understand the need to have one or two children at the most.</p>
  <h3>Making People Aware of Family Planning</h3>
  <p>As population of this world is growing at a rapid pace, raising awareness among people regarding family planning and letting them know about serious after effects of overpopulation can help curb population growth. One of the best way is to let them know about various safe sex techniques and contraceptives methods available to avoid any unwanted pregnancy.</p>
  <h3>Tax Benefits or Concessions</h3>
  <p>Government of various countries might have to come with various policies related to tax exemptions to curb overpopulation. One of them might be to waive of certain part of income tax or lowering rates of income tax for those married couples who have single or two children. As we humans are more inclined towards money, this may produce some positive results.
</p>
  <h3>Knowledge of Sex Education</h3>
  <p>Imparting sex education to young kids at elementary level should be must. Most parents feel shy in discussing such things with their kids which result in their children going out and look out for such information on internet or discuss it with their peers. Mostly, the information is incomplete which results in sexually active teenagers unaware of contraceptives.</p>
