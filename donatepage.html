  <h3 class = "heading"> Here are a few organizations that you can donate to that all individually help our environment. Donating as little as $5 can go a long way. </h3>
  <p> <b><u> Greenpeace:</u></b> The mission for this organization is to lead independent campaign organization that uses peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.</p>
  <input type = "button" align = "center" value = "Donate to Greenpeace here" onClick="parent.open('https://engage.us.greenpeace.org/onlineactions/2DOVhRZiFkSiYRVlQVlCZg2?utm_source=website&utm_medium=actioncard&utm_campaign=170707_summerofresistance&sourceid=1000100&_ga=2.189155298.852274595.1501166659-1860890853.1501079663')"/>
  
  <p> <b><u> Union of Concerned Scientists:</u></b> UCS maintains a national network of nearly 17000 scientists who believe “rigorous analysis is the best way to understand the world’s pressing problems and develop effective solutions to them.” Their work focuses on clean energy solutions, global warming, and the puzzles of large-scale food production. UCS’s testimony has been instrumental in several pieces of important green legislation.</p>

  <p> <b><u> National Resources Defense Council:</u> </b>Called “One of the nation’s most powerful environmental groups” by the New York Times, NRDC combines “the grassroots power of 1.4 million members and online activists with the courtroom clout and expertise of more than 350 lawyers, scientists and other professionals”. This time of year, NRDC offers holiday-ready “green gifts”: your donation results in a gift card describing the action it supports, such as “adopt a wolf in Yellowstone” or “save an acre of whale nursery” to add a tangible meaning to a personalized gift.</p>
   <input type = "button" align = "center" value = "Donate to the National Resources Defense Council here" onClick="parent.open('https://secure.nrdconline.org/site/Donation2?df_id=16977&16977.donation=form1&s_src=WBLFFCDONNGSC&_ga=2.138500659.1457287442.1501167085-72182105.1501167085')"/>
  
  <p> <b><u> Environmental Working Group:</u></b> Known for their annual “Dirty Dozen” list revealing the highest (and lowest) pesticide concentrations in conventionally-grown produce, EWG is known for researching and spreading awareness regarding toxic chemicals, sustainable versus exploitative agricultural practices, consumer product safety, and corporate accountability. Right now, EWG promises that monetary gifts will be doubled through a matching campaign. This is a good pick for those with a passion for clean food.</p>
   <input type = "button" align = "center" value = "Donate to the Environmental Working Group here" onClick="parent.open('http://www.ewg.org/support-our-work/ways-to-donate#.WXoAESMrIy4')"/>
  
  <p> <b><u> Ocean Conservancy:</u> </b>“Ocean Conservancy works to keep the ocean healthy, to keep us healthy.” Current areas of focus include addressing ocean acidification, restoration and oil-spill recovery in the Gulf of Mexico, and protecting the Arctic ecosystem from damage by increased shipping and oil and gas exploration. In the words of Jacques Cousteau, “The sea, the great unifier, is man’s only hope. Now, as never before, the old phrase has a literal meaning: we are all in the same boat.”</p>

  <p> <b><u> The Sierra Club:</u></b> Another household name, the Sierra Club has a popular reputation as less radical than Greenpeace, less likely to cause arguments at the family dinner table. Political lobbying and legislative advocacy have always been central to Sierra Club’s mission. Today the Club focuses on moving beyond fossil fuel dependency and preserving wild spaces from harmful development, as well as offering their signature wilderness trek experiences to individuals across the country.</p>
